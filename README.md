# Software Testing Report

## General selection of Tests

We tried to write tests for the (in our point of view) most important parts of the application. The tests are focused especially on the member- and club management so we do not cover all parts of the full application.

These are only examples to demonstrate the benefits of cucumber and it indirect testcase definition (feature files).

## Test automation approach

For the test automation approach, we selected tests which have at least a priority higher than middle. Therefore, we have the most important use cases in an automation environment and can also use them for automated regression tests.

### Selected Test Cases

* REF_C_MEMBER_0007 - `testCreateMemberWithMandatoryFields`
* REF_A_LORG_0004   - `testCreate_validName`
